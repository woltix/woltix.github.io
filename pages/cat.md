# Cat  

The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.

## Carnivorous mammal
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated  
 species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild  
  members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely  
   and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt  
    rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]  
    
## Anatomy
The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,  
 sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell  
  are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,  
   growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter but a social species.  
    It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other  
     small mammals. It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]

## Female domestic cats 
Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to  
 five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as  
  cat fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets,  
   resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal,  
    and reptile species, and evoking population control.[10]

## Cats in ancient Egypt
Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication  
 was initiated in Ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt.[12][13]

## The second-most popular pet in the United States  

As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States by number of pets  
 owned, after freshwater fish,[14] with 95 million cats owned.[15][16] In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats  
  lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.[17]

## Felis 

Felis is a genus of small and medium-sized cat species native to most of Africa and south of 60째 latitude in Europe  
 and Asia to Indochina. The genus includes the domestic cat. The smallest Felis species is the black-footed cat  
  with a head and body length from 38 to 42 cm (15 to 17 in). The largest is the jungle cat with a head and body  
   length from 62 to 76 cm (24 to 30 in).[1]  
   
### Genetic studies  
Genetic studies indicate that the Felinae genera Felis, Otocolobus and Prionailurus diverged from a Eurasian  
 progenitor of the Felidae about 6.2 million years ago, and that Felis species split off 3.04 to 0.99 million  
  years ago.[2][3]  

## African wildcat  

The African wildcat (Felis lybica) is a wildcat species native to Africa, West and Central Asia up to Rajasthan  
 in India and Xinjiang in China.[2] The IUCN Red List status Least Concern is attributed to the species Felis  
  silvestris, which at the time of assessment also included the African wildcat as a subspecies.[1]
  
### Genetic research
Results of genetic research indicate that the African wildcat diverged into three clades about 173,000 years ago,  
 namely the Near Eastern wildcat, Southern African wildcat and Asiatic wildcat. African wildcats  
  were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Near East, and are the ancestors of the domestic  
   cat (F. catus).[3] In Cyprus, an African wildcat was found in a burial site next to a human skeleton in the  
    Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlement Shillourokambos. The graves are estimated to have been established by  
     Neolithic farmers about 9,500 years ago and are the earliest known evidence for a close association between  
      a human and a cat. Their proximity indicates that the cat may have been tamed or domesticated.[4] Crossings  
       between domestic cats and African wildcats are still common today.[5]
