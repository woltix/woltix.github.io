# Setup

First thing's first: have a website where you have access to edit the HTML :)  

[Create a Pageclip account](https://www.google.com) if you haven't already. Once you have created an account, Pageclip will  
 ask you to setup a site.

## Sites
A site is a website that has one or more forms you want to save to Pageclip. Give your site a  
 name, and its domains.

* **Name** – The name can be anything that helps you remember the site e.g. `Personal  
 Blog`
* **Domains** – Domains are a comma-separated list of domains (with or without subdomains)  
 that can send data to this Pageclip site. For example,  `example.com,localhost`  will  
  save data from forms on  `http://example.com` ,  `http://www.example.com` , and  
   `http://localhost:3000` , but reject data from  `http://www.unicorns.com` .

## Forms

If you have more than one form on your website that you want to store in Pageclip, you will need  
 to create a named form in Pageclip's UI for each form on your site.  

For example, if you have a contact form and a newsletter form, you would create two named forms  
 in Pageclip: contact, and newsletter.
